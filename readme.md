 Create a 2D platformer where the player controls a character who can switch between two dimensions or realities. In one dimension, certain platforms and obstacles are visible and interactable, while in the other, different platforms and obstacles appear. The player must switch between these dimensions to navigate through the level and reach the end point. Add a simple mechanic like collecting keys to unlock doors or portals to progress. Keep the graphics minimalistic and focus on smooth gameplay and interesting level design.
